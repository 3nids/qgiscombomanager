QGIS - Layer / Field Combos Manager

This class is useful if you want to simply manage a layer combo, and
eventually relate it with one (or several) field combos.

The field combos are filled with the names of columns of the currently
selected layer in the layer combo.

In your plugin, create first a LayerCombo:

self.LayerComboManager = LayerCombo(self.iface, self.layerComboWidget)
For more detailed options, see the LayerCombo documentation.

Then, associates some FieldCombo:
self.firstFieldComboManager = FieldCombo(self.firstFieldComboWidget, self.LayerComboManager)
For more detailed options, see the FieldCombo documentation.

You have to save the FieldCombo in self.something, so the variable is not
getting out of scope in python.

The classes offers some convenience methods:
LayerCombo: getLayer()
FieldCombo: getFieldName(), getFieldAlias(), getFieldIndex()
